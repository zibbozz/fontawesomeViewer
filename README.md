# Font Awesome Viewer
---
To get this project working you need to copy a few files by yourself because they are not allowed to be hostet on Github.

The folder structure should look like this. All entries with an arrow are files that are not within the release. You have to download Fontawesome by yourself and place the missing files in the folder. The free version of Fontawesome may work but this project is intended to be used with the pro version.

	/app/css/all.min.css <--
	/app/css/bootstrap.min.css <--
	/app/css/svg-with-js.min.css <--
	/app/js/all.min.js <--
	/app/js/bootstrap.min.js <--
